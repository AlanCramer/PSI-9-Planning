Create A Page that Looks like the Printed Report

1024 px wide
No hover state rendering

No Data Page
Default sort order - Not necessarily matching what is shown on screen
No Focus
No Carets
Assumption - D3-Graphic will never be longer than a page
Data for H503 - (is h502 data there?)
8.5 x 11 form


(Bob)
. Reactivate the Print Button
   A. Open a new page (pop up window) that we display in.

  AC: 
     new URL - has own url
     navigates to a completely blank 
     <state, controller, template>
 
(Alan)  
. Create New Report Dir (for each report) dedicated to printing.
   A. 6 new directives
   B. Need new template files

(Alan)
. Update Horiz Bar Chart Dir to accept "strand" to render only that strand 
   A. remove buttons (except, I guess, the chosen strand)
   B. Wrap this in ng-repeat for each strand in the model

(Dick)
. Skills Table Needs to accept Level input and render only that one
   A. Build a new directive?
   B. Wrap in ng-repeat

(Bob)
. Handle Page Breaks - fake data - demo page breaking - size the story
   Graphics do break correctly
   Table breaks nicely - 
   A. media query 'print.css'
   B. Page breaking
   C. Graphic not breaking
   D. Table breaks (show title with ('continued'))
   E. Repeat the header (?)
   F. See the table footer on the final one

(Dick)
. Header Generation
   A. Directive (which will need a model)
   B. Intellify Service has this data?

(Bob)
. Footer Generation
   A. Do we need a reusable widget (directive)?
