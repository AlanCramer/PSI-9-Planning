<html>

<head>

<script src='d3/d3.min.js'></script>

<style>
 
body {
	font-size:6pt;
} 

@media print {

	body {
		font-size:18pt;
		margin-left:1in;
	}
}

</style>

</head>


<body>

Many headers and footers cannot be represented only by unformatted text. A book title serving as a running head may contain an italic word, for example. A mechanism is needed to move or copy elements into margin boxes. To do this, we add the running() value to the position property, and the element() value to the content property.
@page {
  @top { content: element(header); }
}


And now for a table

<table id='bub' style = 'border: 1px solid black; font-size: 13pt; width:100%'></table>

<script>
	d3.select('body').append('h1').text('D3 is here!');

	var numRows = 45;
	var data = d3.range(numRows);

	d3.select('#bub').selectAll('tr')
		.data(data)
	  .enter()
	    .append('tr')
	    .append('td')
	    .text(function(d,i) { return 'row ' + d + ' cell 1';});

</script>



h1 { position: running(header); }
In this example, the h1 element is placed in the @top margin box, complete with formatting and any descendant elements. It does not display in the normal document flow.

1.2.1 The running() value

position: running(custom-ident) removes the element (and associated ::before and ::after pseudo-elements) from the normal flow, and makes it available to place in a page margin box using element(). The element inherits from its original position in the document, but does not display there.

Name:	position
New values:	running()
Media:	paged
  running() = string( <custom-ident> )
HTML:

<p class="rh"><i>Miranda v. Arizona</i> in Context</p>
<h2><i>Miranda v. Arizona</i> in Context</h2>
CSS:

 @top-center {
   content: element(heading); 
   }
   
 p.rh { 
   position: running(heading); 
   }
 
 p.rh::before { 
   content: counter(page) ' / '; 
   }
running header using running elements
Running element in page margin box
The element value() can only be used in page margin boxes. And it cannot be combined with other possible values for the content property.

This idea would be much more useful if we could also copy (rather than just move) elements. That would avoid the duplication of HTML in the example above.

Bert Bos has proposed an alternative syntax, which allows both moving and copying elements into running heads. In the example below, h2 elements appear in their normal place in the document, but are also copied into running heads.

h2 {
display: block;
running: chapter;
font-size: 18pt;
font-weight: bold;
}

h2:running {
display: inline;
font-size: 11pt;
font-weight: normal;
font-variant: small-caps;
letter-spacing: 1pt;
}

@page {
  @top-center {
    content: element(chapter);
    }
  }
Name:	running
Value:	<custom-ident>
Initial:	none
Applies to:	elements
Inherited:	no
Media:	all
Computed value:	specified value
Percentages:	N/A
1.2.2 The element() value

The element() value of the content property places an element (which has been removed from the normal flow via running()) in a page margin box. Whenever the value of the element changes, the value of element() is updated.

Just as with string(), element() takes an optional keyword to describe which value should be used in the case of multiple assignments on a page. User agents must be able to recall many values, as element() can return past, current, or future values of the assignment.

Name:	content
New values:	element()
Media:	paged
  element() = string( <custom-ident> [ , [ first | start | last | first-except] ]? )
2 Footnotes

Ancillary content may be moved to the bottom or side of a page. A footnote is created when such content moves to the bottom of the page, leaving a reference indicator.
2.1 Terminology

Footnotes are complex objects (see the footnote section at [dpub-latinreq]), so it will be helpful to define some terms before proceeding.

page with footnotes
Footnote terminology
footnote element
The element containing the content of the footnote, which will be removed from the flow and displayed as a footnote.
footnote marker (also known as footnote number)
A number or symbol adjacent to the footnote body, identifying the particular footnote. The footnote marker should use the same number or symbol as the corresponding footnote call, although the marker may contain additional punctuation.
footnote body
The footnote marker is placed before the footnote element, and together they represent the footnote body, which will be placed in the footnote area.
footnote call (also known as footnote reference)
A number or symbol, found in the main text, which points to the footnote body.
footnote area
The page area used to display footnotes.
footnote rule (also known as footnote separator)
A horizontal rule is often used to separate the footnote area from the rest of the page. The separator (and the entire footnote area) cannot be rendered on a page with no footnotes.
2.2 Creating footnotes

An element becomes a footnote by applying float: footnote to that element. This triggers the following actions:
The footnote element is removed from the flow, and a ::footnote-call pseudo-element is inserted in its place, which serves as a reference to the footnote.
A ::footnote-marker pseudo-element, identifying the footnote, is placed at the beginning of the footnote element. Together this is the footnote body.
The footnote counter is incremented.
The footnote body is placed in the footnote area at the bottom of the page. Footnote elements from a given page are placed in the footnote area of that page in document order.
HTML:
<p>Though the body was erect, the head was thrown back so that the closed eyes were pointed towards the needle of the tell-tale that swung from a beam in the ceiling.<span class="footnote">The cabin-compass is called the tell-tale, because without going to the compass at the helm, the Captain, while below, can inform himself of the course of the ship.</span></p>
CSS:

@page {
  @footnote {
    float: bottom;
  }
}

span.footnote { float: footnote; }
Why is float:bottom used with the footnote area? Floating footnotes to the footnote area, and then floating the footnote area itself, seems overly complex, given that implementations don’t allow the footnote area to float anywhere else. Note that some implementations do allow the footnote area to be absolutely positioned.

2.3 Types of footnotes

The following new value of the float property creates a footnote element:
Name:	float
New values:	footnote
Media:	paged
footnote
each footnote element is placed in the footnote area of the page
The footnote-display property determines whether a footnote is displayed as a block element or inline element.

Name:	footnote-display
Value:	block | inline | compact
Initial:	block
Applies to:	elements
Inherited:	no
Media:	paged
Computed value:	specified value
Percentages:	N/A
block
The footnote element is placed in the footnote area as a block element
inline
The footnote element is placed in the footnote area as an inline element
compact
The user agent determines whether a given footnote element is placed as a block element or an inline element. If two or more footnotes could fit on the same line in the footnote area, they should be placed inline.
2.4 The footnote area

A page area that can be used to display footnotes is described in the page context using an @footnote rule. This rule defines a box that, if used, will contain all the footnote elements that appear on that page.
How would one describe this in the grammar of CSS3-Page?

2.4.1 Positioning of the footnote area

The bottom margin edge of the footnote area is positioned so that it touches the bottom of the page area. The footnote area can only contain footnotes.
How do footnotes work in multi-column text? Prince uses float: prince-column-footnote to create a footnote at the bottom of a column rather than the bottom of a page.

Implementations that support footnotes generally support page floats like float: bottom. Page floats should end up above the footnote area. How might this be specified?

2.4.2 Size of the footnote area

The max-height property on the footnote area limits the size of this area, unless the page contains only footnotes (as may happen on the last page of a document).

Since it is undesirable for a page to consist only of footnotes, user agents may set a default max-height value on the footnote area.

2.5 The Footnote Counter

The footnote counter is a predefined counter associated with the footnote element. Its value is the number or symbol used to identify the footnote. This value is used in both the footnote call and the footnote marker. It should be incremented for each footnote.

2.5.1 Values of the footnote counter

The footnote counter, like other counters, may use any counter style. Footnotes often use a sequence of symbols.

::footnote-call { content: counter(footnote, symbols('*', '†', '‡', '§')); }

::footnote-marker { content: counter(footnote, symbols('*', '†', '‡', '§')) '. '; }
2.5.2 Resetting the footnote counter

The footnote counter may be reset on each page.

@page {
  counter-reset: footnote;
  @footnote { … }
}
Note that the value of the footnote counter should depend on the position of the footnote element in the document tree, not where it is eventually placed. A footnote element may sometimes be placed on the page after the footnote call, but the same counter value must be used for both.

2.6 The footnote-call pseudo-element

A ::footnote-call pseudo-element is inserted in place of the footnote element when the latter is removed from the flow. By default, the content of this pseudo-element is the value of the footnote counter, styled as a superscripted number.
::footnote-call {
content: counter(footnote);
vertical-align: baseline;
font-size: 100%;
line-height: inherit;
font-variant-position: super;
}
2.7 The footnote-marker pseudo-element

The ::footnote-marker pseudo-element represents the footnote element’s marker, the number or symbol that identifies each footnote. This pseudo-element behaves like a ::marker pseudo-element, as defined in [CSS3LIST]. It is placed at the beginning of the superior parent’s content, and is inline by default. The ::footnote-marker can be styled just as other ::marker elements can be. The default style should include list-style-position: inside.
::footnote-marker {
content: counter(footnote);
}

::footnote-marker::after {
content: '. ';
}
2.8 Rendering footnotes and footnote policy

Rendering footnotes can be complex. If a footnote falls near the bottom of the page, there may not be enough room on the page for the footnote body. The footnote-policy property allows authors some influence over the rendering of difficult pages.

Name:	footnote-policy
Value:	auto | line | block
Initial:	auto
Applies to:	elements
Inherited:	no
Media:	paged
Computed value:	specified value
Percentages:	N/A
auto
The user agent chooses how to render footnotes, and may place the footnote body on a later page than the footnote reference. A footnote body must never be placed on a page before the footnote reference.
line
If a given footnote body cannot be placed on the current page due to lack of space, the user agent introduces a forced page break at the start of the line containing the footnote reference, so that both the reference and the footnote body fall on the next page. Note that the user agent must honor widow and orphan settings when doing this, and so may need to insert the page break on an earlier line.
block
As with line, except a forced page break is introduced before the paragraph that contains the footnote.
We need an algorithm for laying out footnotes

2.9 Future directions

The next level will include sidenotes, column footnotes, and multiple footnote areas.
3 Selecting Pages

A paginated document consists of a sequence of pages. [[CSS3PAGE]] defines page selectors, which allow the selection of the first page of the document, left and right pages, and blank pages. Here we extend the idea of page selectors to enable the selection of arbitrary document pages.
3.1 Page Selectors

The nth() page pseudo-class allows the selection of arbitrary document pages. This pseudo-class takes an argument of the form An + B as defined in [CSS3SYN]. When applied to the default @page rule, nth() selects the document page whose index matches the argument.
nth() = ( An+B [of <custom-ident>]?)
nth() is not related to the page counter, which may reset and use various numbering schemes.

When the nth() selector is applied to a named page, and that named page is part of a page-group (see below), it selects the nth page in the page group.

@page :nth(1)
This selects the first page of the document.
@page :nth(2n)
This selects all even document pages.
3.2 Page groups

Many paginated documents have a repeating structure, consisting of many chapters, sections, or articles. The first page of each subdivision often requires special treatment, but [CSS3PAGE] doesn’t define a way to select the first page of each chapter (as distinct from the first page of the entire document).
When the page property is applied to an element that also has a forced break property applied, a page group is created. The page group is the collection of all pages created by an instance of that element. When a new instance of the element is rendered, a new page group is started.

A page may be part of several page groups, as a given page group may have ancestors or descendants that are part of another page group.

CSS:
div { page: A }
child { page: B }

A page may be part of several page groups.
