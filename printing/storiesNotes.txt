Angular Route for a new Report Page
   Place holder page
   Identify Issue/Workshop route of printed version
    Q: query string or URL path?
    Q: date range picker - Printed version has the whole year, right?
    Q: state of UI (tooltips, previous date period (LC)) ignored in printed report


(Alan + Chuck)
Make a new Template and Render WAC as a printed report
    Not worrying about pagination, but want to see the input to phantomjs
   < make new stories around fixing it >
   < refactoring of existing code >
   Q: How pervasive will the concept of 'for-print-report' need to be in the code?
   Q: How do we minimize this?

(Alan + Chuck)
LRSTable massaging
  calculating size on page
  breaking into new tables


< Alan is very skeptical >
LRSTable with paged media (downgrade phantomjs 1.9.7)


Server -
    AI: Alan harass Adam and Rich for server
    Chuck: Ask JH for EC2 instance borrowing
    'Hello World' Server
        Where does this code go?
        Alan: Make a Repo
        Deployment scripts (?) - npm install
    Install Phantomjs
        add to deployment scripts
    Build a router to handle
        if Node then Express
        if JBOSS then match the DCT approach
        Puts { classId, reportId }
        Response of URL to printed report, or report!
    WebSockets (give pdf to client)- Spike, return document when built
    WebSockets (talk to WebWorkers)- Spike, coordinate phantom instances
    Authentication
    Queuing Spike
        investigate RabbitMQ and other queuing technologies
        AmazonSimpleQueueService
        Pick one
        Simulate hitting the fake server with simulated print reports
            Adding and removing print jobs
        Simulate spinning up new Phantom instances (web workers)

    Do we need queuing? (we think 'yes')
    Do we want a separate phantom process for each report?

    Interactive or Polling?
    Batch considerations?
    Ping Rubesh, JBOSS vs Node

    Where is the code?

    Part of TLSP vs Standalone?
    Web Sockets? (worth investigating)
    Polling? (fall back)
    Direct return or copy to S3 Bucket?
    John Hubner ... EC2 instances available?


Redesign WAC Table (at least for print report)
  Each student gets a table
  Transpose the Table
  Rows are skills
